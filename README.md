KIL Waste Heat to Power project, India

The project activity entails utilisation of waste heat of flue gases generated in DRI kilns of sponge
iron plant of Kamachi Industries Ltd (KIL, formerly Kamachi Sponge & Power Corporation
Limited, Project Proponent or PP hereafter) in power generation. The power produced is used
actively at the sponge iron plant of KIL. Apart from the utilization of the power at the sponge iron
plant, the surplus power generated by the Waste Heat Recovery Boilers (WHRB) plant is consumed
by the adjoining steel plant owned by KIL which is within the same premises as the WHRB plant.
The project activity started commercial production from 29/12/2007.
________________
This power, from the WHRB plant, displaces equivalent amount of power from the Tamil Nadu
Electricity Board (TNEB) grid, which is part of Southern Region (SR) grid in India and is primarily
fossil fuel based. The project activity results in reduced carbon emissions by avoiding generation of
this power in grid connected power stations. The grid emission factor for SR grid is as the
recommended UCR conservative estimate for the years 2018-2022.

KIL has set up 04 nos. DRI kilns of 100 TPD each at its sponge iron production unit. Annual
sponge iron production is ~120000 TPA. Each of the kilns generates ~25000 Nm3
/hr of high temperature flue gases. The temperature of flue gases from the kiln leaving After Burner Chamber
(ABC) is at ~950-1000 0C. This waste heat of flue gases is utilised in the generation of steam in
(WHRB), which is further expanded in a single bleed-condensing turbine of 10MW to generate
power. Steam from 04 nos. WHRB is taken to the turbine through a common header.
